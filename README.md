# Stellar-Population-studies-using-MAStar-SDSS-Data

In this statistical study of stellar population (from a MaStar SDSS dataset) we have tried to plot and interpret the following
1. Distribution of stars for various stellar parameters.
2. Correlations between stellar parameters.
3. Black Body radiation emitted by stars and the presence of certain elements.
